# gfxCardStatus
by Cody Krieger

gfxCardStatus is an open-source menu bar application for OS X that allows users of unibody MacBook Pros
with dual GPUs to monitor the status of, and switch between said GPUs.

## Supported MacBook Pro Models

- Late 2008-2009 MacBook Pros with NVIDIA GeForce 9400M integrated and 9600M GT discrete GPUs
- 2010 MacBook Pros with Intel HD integrated and NVIDIA GeForce 330M GT discrete GPUs
- 2011 MacBook Pros with Intel HD 3000 integrated and AMD Radeon HD 6xxxM discrete GPUs

## Features

- allows locking the system on one GPU or the other, or allowing automatic switching
- does not require you to log out or restart to switch GPUs - it's all done on the fly!
- allows you to see which GPU is in use at a glance in the menu bar - "i" for integrated, "d" for discrete
- Notifications ensure that you know exactly when the GPU changes, provided you have Growl installed or OS X 10.8
- light, fast, and minimalist. doesn't get in your way, and uses little to no system resources
