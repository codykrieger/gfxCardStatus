***********************************

gfxCardStatus is an open-source menu bar application for OS X that allows users of unibody MacBook Pros
with dual GPUs to monitor the status of, and switch between said GPUs. Supported MacBook Pros/graphics chipsets:

Late 2008-2009 MacBook Pros with NVIDIA GeForce 9400M integrated and 9600M GT discrete GPUs
2010 MacBook Pros with Intel HD integrated and NVIDIA GeForce 330M GT discrete GPUs
2011 MacBook Pros with Intel HD 3000 integrated and AMD Radeon HD 6xxxM discrete GPUs

Features:
- allows locking the system on one GPU or the other, or allowing automatic switching
- does not require you to log out or restart to switch GPUs - it's all done on the fly!
- allows you to see which GPU is in use at a glance in the menu bar - "i" for integrated, "d" for discrete
- Growl support ensures that you know exactly when the GPU changes, provided you have Growl installed
- light, fast, and minimalist. doesn't get in your way, and uses little to no system resources
